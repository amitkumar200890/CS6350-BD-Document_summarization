I think every person has different interests. I have friends that have completely different jobs and interests, and I've met them in very different parts of my life.

Seeking a ninth title at his hometown event, and a 99th overall, Federer will play 93th-ranked Marius Copil on Sunday. Federer dominated the 20th-ranked Medvedev and had his first match-point chance to break serve again at 5-1. He then dropped his serve to love, and let another match point slip in Medvedev's next service game by netting a backhand. He clinched on his fourth chance when Medvedev netted from the baseline. Copil upset expectations of a Federer final against Alexander Zverev in a 6-3, 6-7 (6), 6-4 win over the fifth-ranked German in the earlier semifinal. The Romanian aims for a first title after arriving at Basel without a career win over a top-10 opponent. Copil has two after also beating No. 6 Marin Cilic in the second round. Copil fired 26 aces past Zverev and never dropped serve, clinching after 2 1/2 hours with a forehand volley winner to break Zverev for the second time in the semifinal. He came through two rounds of qualifying last weekend to reach the Basel main draw, including beating Zverev's older brother, Mischa. Federer had an easier time than in his only previous match against Medvedev, a three-setter at Shanghai two weeks ago.","http://www.tennis.com/pro-game/2018/10/copil-stuns-5th-ranked-zverev-to-reach-swiss-indoors-final/77721/"],[3,"Tennis: Roger Federer ignored deadline set by 'new' Davis Cup","Roger Federer has revealed that organisers of the re-launched and condensed Davis Cup gave him three days to decide if he would commit to the controversial competition. Speaking at the Swiss Indoors tournament where he will play in Sundays final against Romanian qualifier Marius Copil, the world number three said that given the impossibly short time frame to make a decision, he opted out of any commitment. They only left me three days to decide, Federer said. I didnt to have time to consult with all the people I had to consult. I could not make a decision in that time, so I told them to do what they wanted. The 20-time Grand Slam champion has voiced doubts about the wisdom of the one-week format to be introduced by organisers Kosmos, who have promised the International Tennis Federation up to $3 billion in prize money over the next quarter-century. The competition is set to feature 18 countries in the November 18-24 finals in Madrid next year, and will replace the classic home-and-away ties played four times per year for decades. Kosmos is headed by Barcelona footballer Gerard Pique, who is hoping fellow Spaniard Rafael Nadal will play in the upcoming event. Novak Djokovic has said he will give precedence to the ATPs intended re-launch of the defunct World Team Cup in January 2020, at various Australian venues. Major players feel that a big event in late November combined with one in January before the Australian Open will mean too much tennis and too little rest. Federer said earlier this month in Shanghai in that his chances of playing the Davis Cup were all but non-existent. I highly doubt it, of course. Well see what happens, he said. I dont think this was designed for me, anyhow. This was designed for the future generation of players. Argentina and Britain received wild cards to the new-look event, and will compete along with the four 2018 semi-finalists and the 12 teams who win qualifying rounds next February. I dont like being under that kind of pressure, Federer said of the deadline Kosmos handed him.","https://scroll.in/field/899938/tennis-roger-federer-ignored-deadline-set-by-new-davis-cup"],[4,"Nishikori to face off against Anderson in Vienna final","Kei Nishikori will try to end his long losing streak in ATP finals and Kevin Anderson will go for his second title of the year at the Erste Bank Open on Sunday.

A winner of 11 ATP events, Nishikori hasn't triumphed since winning in Memphis in February 2016. He has lost eight straight finals since.

Nishikori leads Anderson 4-2 on career matchups, but the South African won their only previous meeting this year. With a victory on Sunday, Anderson will qualify for the ATP Finals. Currently in ninth place, Nishikori with a win could move to within 125 points of the cut for the eight-man event in London next month. Nishikori held serve throughout against Kukushkin, who came through qualifying. He used his first break point to close out the first set before going up 3-0 in the second and wrapping up the win on his first match point. Against Verdasco, Anderson hit nine of his 19 aces in the opening set.

The 20-time Grand Slam winner is chasing his 99th ATP title at the Swiss Indoors this week and he faces Jan-Lennard Struff in the second round on Thursday (6pm BST). Davenport enjoyed most of her success in the late 1990s and her third and final major tournament win came at the 2000 Australian Open. But she claims the mentality of professional tennis players slowly began to change after the new millennium. It seems pretty friendly right now, said Davenport. I think there is a really nice environment and a great atmosphere, especially between some of the veteran players helping some of the younger players out. It's a very pleasant atmosphere, I'd have to say, around the locker rooms. I felt like the best weeks that I had to get to know players when I was playing were the Fed Cup weeks or the Olympic weeks, not necessarily during the tournaments. And even though maybe we had smaller teams, I still think we kept to ourselves quite a bit. Not always, but I really feel like in the mid-2000 years there was a huge shift of the attitudes of the top players and being more friendly and being more giving, and a lot of that had to do with players like Roger coming up. I just felt like it really kind of changed where people were a little bit, definitely in the '90s, a lot more quiet, into themselves, and then it started to become better. Meanwhile, Federer is hoping he can improve his service game as he hunts his ninth Swiss Indoors title this week. I didn't serve very well [against first-round opponent Filip Kranjovic, Federer said. I think I was misfiring the corners, I was not hitting the lines enough. Clearly you make your life more difficult, but still I was up 6-2, 3-1, break points, so things could have ended very quickly today, even though I didn't have the best serve percentage stats. But maybe that's exactly what caught up to me eventually.

He picked me up at 5.30am, half an hour early because he couldnt sleep. Or hadnt slept, to be specific. Not because hed been out on a bender or anything  those days were in the past. The former Wimbledon junior champion was full of hope, excited about getting his life back together after a troubled few years and a touch-and-go battle with pancreatitis. Im pleased with that, he said after grinding out an eight-over-par front nine at the not-so-royal Northbridge club in Sydney and smashing down an egg- and-bacon roll at the halfway house. To most players of his rare sporting gifts, such a modest return would be unacceptable. To Reid the 15-marker, just being up and at em was enough; a few bogeys and one well-made par  broomstick putter and all  vindication for his recent decision to renew his membership at nearby Bankstown. Exhausted after spending half his round deep in the bushes searching for my ball, as well as those of two other golfers hed never met before, our incredibly giving designated driver asked if we didnt mind going straight home after signing off so he could rest up a little before heading to work. Fourteen years after sharing centre court with Roger Federer in the third round of the Australian Open, Reid was now running the counter and coaching kids - but sadly now never mine- in suburban Sydney at the Matraville tennis and squash centre run by his father Bob and beautiful mother Sandra, herselfa former professional. Quite the fall from grace for a prodigious talent once afforded a 3000-word spread in The New York Times. With sponsors and the world at his feet, Reid was 14 then and being mentored by Nick Bollettieri, who fashioned the likes of Andre Agassi, Maria Sharapova, Monica Seles and Jim Courier into world No.1s. Reid, too, was earmarked for the very top, only for injuries and illness to cruel his career. On the up again after taking salvation in the bottle, Reid was found dead on Tuesday aged just 34. I never got over what happened to me when I was 19, he told AAP last week. Just as his senior career got legs, Reid was derailed by a debilitating bout of glandular fever. The life-changing setback hit only weeks after the then-teenage wonder boy announced his arrival as a grand slam threat by throwing up all over Rod Laver Arena during a fighting five-set second-round win over Sargis Sargsian. The epic victory set-up his showdown with Federer, who would go on to win his first Australian Open. I was their golden boy then, he said of his relationship with Tennis Australia. Now they wont even give me tickets (to the Open). A Davis Cup pick and on the cusp of the worlds 100 by 18, Reid had few other complaints - just a lingering sense of what might have been. Hed backed up his last-32 showingat Melbourne Park with a string of wins over elites including French Open champion and then world No.9 Gaston Gaudio and Roland Garros runner-up Martin Verkerk in 2004 before illness struck. I was on a nice trajectorythen, Reid recalled.If I hadnt got sick, I think I could have started pushing towards the second week at the slams and then who knows. Duringa comeback attempt some five years later, Reid added Bernard Tomic and 2018 US Open Federer slayer John Millman to his list of career scalps. He had one of the best backhands, I think, going around, Millman told AAP. But my fondest memory is probably him coming back in Spain with his father and Todd trying to order a ham, cheese and tomato sandwich in the most Aussie English I ever heard. Among his lesser known achievements - but even more significantto me - was an injured Reids effort to reach the final of the Manly Seaside, a prestigious Christmas-time event won backin the day by the likes of legends Rod Laver, Ken Rosewall, Frank Sedgman, John Bromwich, Lew Hoad, Neal Fraser, Fred Stolle, Evonne Goolagong and Australias last womens Australian Open champion, Christine ONeil. Hampered by a shoulder injury, Reid served under-arm - UNDER-ARM - throughout the entire tournament yet still made the decider. I was always happy to work hard, he said. He had hoped the mercurial Nick Kyrgios would do the same. A big fan and believer in the enigmatic Canberran, Reid didnt want to see Kyrgioss career slip away like his did. Full effort he wouldnt fail, Reid said of Kyrgios. Full effort Nick could live out his tennis like a (Tomas) Berdych or (Jo- Wilfried) Tsonga, consistently making second week,quarters, semis, finals of slams - and then hopefully more. Time will tell for Nick, but hes still young. Todd Reid was still young, too.

When I'm on the courts or when I'm on the court playing, I'm a competitor and I want to beat every single person whether they're in the locker room or across the net. So I'm not the one to strike up a conversation about the weather and know that in the next few minutes I have to go and try to win a tennis match. I'm a pretty competitive girl. I say my hellos, but I'm not sending any players flowers as well. Uhm, I'm not really friendly or close to many players. I have not a lot of friends away from the courts.' When she said she is not really close to a lot of players, is that something strategic that she is doing? Is it different on the men's tour than the women's tour? 'No, not at all. I think just because you're in the same sport doesn't mean that you have to be friends with everyone just because you're categorized, you're a tennis player, so you're going to get along with tennis players. I think every person has different interests. I have friends that have completely different jobs and interests, and I've met them in very different parts of my life. I think everyone just thinks because we're tennis players we should be the greatest of friends. But ultimately tennis is just a very small part of what we do.

Seeking a ninth title at his hometown event, and a 99th overall, Federer will play 93th-ranked Marius Copil on Sunday. Federer dominated the 20th-ranked Medvedev and had his first match-point chance to break serve again at 5-1. He then dropped his serve to love, and let another match point slip in Medvedev's next service game by netting a backhand. He clinched on his fourth chance when Medvedev netted from the baseline. Copil upset expectations of a Federer final against Alexander Zverev in a 6-3, 6-7 (6), 6-4 win over the fifth-ranked German in the earlier semifinal. The Romanian aims for a first title after arriving at Basel without a career win over a top-10 opponent. Copil has two after also beating No. 6 Marin Cilic in the second round. Copil fired 26 aces past Zverev and never dropped serve, clinching after 2 1/2 hours with a forehand volley winner to break Zverev for the second time in the semifinal. He came through two rounds of qualifying last weekend to reach the Basel main draw, including beating Zverev's older brother, Mischa. Federer had an easier time than in his only previous match against Medvedev, a three-setter at Shanghai two weeks ago.</td><td>http://www.tennis.com/pro-game/2018/10/copil-stuns-5th-ranked-zverev-to-reach-swiss-indoors-final/77721/</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Tennis: Roger Federer ignored deadline set by 'new' Davis Cup</td><td>Roger Federer has revealed that organisers of the re-launched and condensed Davis Cup gave him three days to decide if he would commit to the controversial competition. Speaking at the Swiss Indoors tournament where he will play in Sundays final against Romanian qualifier Marius Copil, the world number three said that given the impossibly short time frame to make a decision, he opted out of any commitment. They only left me three days to decide, Federer said. I didnt to have time to consult with all the people I had to consult. I could not make a decision in that time, so I told them to do what they wanted. The 20-time Grand Slam champion has voiced doubts about the wisdom of the one-week format to be introduced by organisers Kosmos, who have promised the International Tennis Federation up to $3 billion in prize money over the next quarter-century. The competition is set to feature 18 countries in the November 18-24 finals in Madrid next year, and will replace the classic home-and-away ties played four times per year for decades. Kosmos is headed by Barcelona footballer Gerard Pique, who is hoping fellow Spaniard Rafael Nadal will play in the upcoming event. Novak Djokovic has said he will give precedence to the ATPs intended re-launch of the defunct World Team Cup in January 2020, at various Australian venues. Major players feel that a big event in late November combined with one in January before the Australian Open will mean too much tennis and too little rest. Federer said earlier this month in Shanghai in that his chances of playing the Davis Cup were all but non-existent. I highly doubt it, of course. Well see what happens, he said. I dont think this was designed for me, anyhow. This was designed for the future generation of players. Argentina and Britain received wild cards to the new-look event, and will compete along with the four 2018 semi-finalists and the 12 teams who win qualifying rounds next February. I dont like being under that kind of pressure, Federer said of the deadline Kosmos handed him.</td><td>https://scroll.in/field/899938/tennis-roger-federer-ignored-deadline-set-by-new-davis-cup</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Nishikori to face off against Anderson in Vienna final</td><td>Kei Nishikori will try to end his long losing streak in ATP finals and Kevin Anderson will go for his second title of the year at the Erste Bank Open on Sunday. The fifth-seeded Nishikori reached his third final of 2018 after beating Mikhail Kukushkin of Kazakhstan 6-4, 6-3 in the semifinals. A winner of 11 ATP events, Nishikori hasn't triumphed since winning in Memphis in February 2016. He has lost eight straight finals since. The second-seeded Anderson defeated Fernando Verdasco 6-3, 3-6, 6-4. Anderson has a shot at a fifth career title and second of the year after winning in New York in February. Nishikori leads Anderson 4-2 on career matchups, but the South African won their only previous meeting this year. With a victory on Sunday, Anderson will qualify for the ATP Finals. Currently in ninth place, Nishikori with a win could move to within 125 points of the cut for the eight-man event in London next month. Nishikori held serve throughout against Kukushkin, who came through qualifying. He used his first break point to close out the first set before going up 3-0 in the second and wrapping up the win on his first match point. Against Verdasco, Anderson hit nine of his 19 aces in the opening set. The Spaniard broke Anderson twice in the second but didn't get another chance on the South African's serve in the final set.</td><td>http://www.tennis.com/pro-game/2018/10/nishikori-beats-kukushkin-in-vienna-for-3rd-final-of-season/77719/</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Roger Federer has made this huge change to tennis - Lindsay Davenport</td><td>Federer, 37, first broke through on tour over two decades ago and he has since gone on to enjoy a glittering career.

Davenport enjoyed most of her success in the late 1990s and her third and final major tournament win came at the 2000 Australian Open. But she claims the mentality of professional tennis players slowly began to change after the new millennium. It seems pretty friendly right now, said Davenport. I think there is a really nice environment and a great atmosphere, especially between some of the veteran players helping some of the younger players out. It's a very pleasant atmosphere, I'd have to say, around the locker rooms. I felt like the best weeks that I had to get to know players when I was playing were the Fed Cup weeks or the Olympic weeks, not necessarily during the tournaments. And even though maybe we had smaller teams, I still think we kept to ourselves quite a bit. Not always, but I really feel like in the mid-2000 years there was a huge shift of the attitudes of the top players and being more friendly and being more giving, and a lot of that had to do with players like Roger coming up. I just felt like it really kind of changed where people were a little bit, definitely in the '90s, a lot more quiet, into themselves, and then it started to become better. Meanwhile, Federer is hoping he can improve his service game as he hunts his ninth Swiss Indoors title this week. I didn't serve very well [against first-round opponent Filip Kranjovic, Federer said. I think I was misfiring the corners, I was not hitting the lines enough. Clearly you make your life more difficult, but still I was up 6-2, 3-1, break points, so things could have ended very quickly today, even though I didn't have the best serve percentage stats. But maybe that's exactly what caught up to me eventually.
